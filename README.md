# Canny-Edge-Detection
- Implemented the Canny Edge Detector
- Images are smoothed using a Gaussian filter and then their orientations and magnitudes are calculated.
- Non-maximum suppression is performed on the image pixels to discover true edge pixels.
- Using hysterisis thresholding, dominant edge pixels are discovered using eight way connectivity.
